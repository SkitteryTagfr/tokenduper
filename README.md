# Tokenduper made by Skittery
## A project i worked on for a while. Inspired by EinTim's [video](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1173682365772599449/1183840689528774756/2023-11-15_23-00-07.mov?ex=66824f4f&is=6680fdcf&hm=172cf2225bf47a685967721ec9276200b27aea4532c2bdb11850a6277958771d&).
I wanted to replicate it and make a unresetable token. After a while I gave up... If anyone wants to try you sure can!
# What it is:
Its a script that replicates the Token creation on Discord and makes a second or more Token for one Account.
Pretty useless without the Top part but still pretty funny.

# Credits
Made by me myself, inspired by EinTim as i said above.
